# Revolutionizing Traffic Flow Predictions with SGCN-LSTM

# Overview
This project explores the SGCN-LSTM model, a hybrid approach to traffic flow prediction. By combining Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, the model captures spatial and temporal dependencies effectively, outperforming existing models.

# Deliverables
1. **Medium Article**: A comprehensive article detailing the methodology and findings of SGCN-LSTM.
2. **Presentation**: A PowerPoint slide deck summarizing the project's key points.
3. **Video**: A recorded walkthrough of the presentation.
4. **Code Repository**: Public GitHub repository with reproducible code and datasets.

# Key Highlights
- **Dataset**: PEMS-BAY for short-term traffic speed prediction.
- **Metrics**:
  - MAE: 0.4347
  - RMSE: 0.7946
